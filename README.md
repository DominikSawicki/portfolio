# About Me
My name is Dominik Sawicki. I'm a master in management. I graduated from 
University of Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland. Recently I realized that I'd like to become software tester. My long-term goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills. I'd like to share all of my experience in this readme file.
